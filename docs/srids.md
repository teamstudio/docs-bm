# Stored IDs

The Stored IDs feature allows the saving of an ID file - together with its password - inside Build Manager. This enables the Build manager Administrator (the person who will be creating Promotion Paths on a regular bases) to create Promotion Paths which utilize the ID file without actually granting them access to the actual ID file or its password. Multiple IDs and their passwords may be stored in Build Manager each used for a different task e.g. signing a database or performing a promotion.
