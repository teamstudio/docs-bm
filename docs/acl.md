It is normally a requirement that the ID being used to perform the promotion be given Manager rights to the database being promoted, otherwise when the database is promoted a second time, the promoting ID will not have rights to overwrite it.

The new ACL entry appears in the right pane, under the Build or Promotion Path to which it applies.

If you create an ACL Entry action, Build Manager requires that you have a least one manager defined in the ACL entries before you can promote.
